This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that enables features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized client-side routing. The starter kit leverages Next.js 15's advanced capabilities including the App Router, React Server Components, and built-in performance optimizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

To create a production build

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To serve a production build

```bash
npm run serve
# you may need to install serve globally:
npm i -g serve
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Committing code

This project uses Husky and a custom commit message script to ensure consistent and informative commit messages. When you're ready to commit your changes:

1. Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

2. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit
```

3. Husky will take care of the rest and ask you some important questions to help you create a good commit message.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Tackl project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── storybook
    ├── app
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── .env
    ├── eslint.config.js
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .npmrc
    ├── .deployment_guide.md
    ├── .jsconfig.json
    ├── next.config.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── docs
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: The core dependency directory containing all external packages and libraries your project relies on. These are automatically installed based on your package.json specifications and should never be manually modified or committed to version control.

2.  **`/storybook`**: Houses all Storybook configuration and setup files. Storybook is our component development environment where we build and test UI components in isolation. Individual component stories are co-located with their components in `src/parts/YourComponent` for better maintainability. Note that fonts must be imported into `.storybook/preview.js` to be available in your stories (see example in that file for importing Inter font).

3.  **`./app`**: The main application directory utilizing Next.js 13+'s App Router architecture. This modern routing approach offers enhanced features like server components, layouts, and more streamlined data fetching compared to the legacy Pages Router. [Learn more about App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)

4.  **`./public`**: Static asset directory for files that need to be publicly accessible. This includes images, fonts, icons, and other media files that don't require processing. Files in this directory are served as-is from the root URL path.

5.  **`/src`**: The primary source code directory containing all front-end application code. This follows the conventional source directory structure and includes components, utilities, hooks, and other application logic organized in a modular fashion.

6.  **`.env`**: Environment configuration file storing sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and other environment-specific variables. This file should never be committed to version control - use .env.example instead for documentation.

7.  **`.gitignore`**: Version control configuration file that specifies which files and directories Git should ignore, such as node_modules, build outputs, and environment files.

8.  **`.npmrc`**: NPM configuration file that customizes package manager behavior for this project. In Tackl, it's primarily used for configuring GSAP Club access and other package-specific settings.

9.  **`deployment_guide`**: Comprehensive AWS deployment documentation providing step-by-step instructions for setting up and deploying your Tackl project to production.

10. **`jsconfig.json`**: JavaScript project configuration file that enhances development experience by enabling TypeScript-like features, custom path aliases, and better IntelliSense support in modern IDEs.

11. **`eslint.config.js`**: Modern ESLint flat configuration file that provides code quality rules, linting standards, and code formatting integration with Prettier for consistent code style across the project.

12. **`next.config.js`**: Next.js framework configuration file where you can customize build settings, add environment variables, configure plugins, and modify webpack behavior. Essential for tailoring Next.js to your project's needs.

13. **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated dependency lock file that ensures consistent installations across different environments by recording the exact version of each installed package. Should be committed to version control but never manually edited.

14. **`package.json`**: Project manifest file defining your application's dependencies, scripts, metadata, and other important configurations. This is the central configuration file for your Node.js/JavaScript project.

15. **`docs`**: Comprehensive documentation directory containing detailed guides, best practices, and technical documentation specific to working with Tackl's features and conventions.

16. **`README.md`**: The primary project documentation file providing an overview, setup instructions, and essential information for developers working with the project. You're reading it right now!
